## Research

I'm a new developer, and I want to use AI to code, but I want to understand and review all the code that's being developed.

Before starting with a feature, I want to first get an overview of the flow of code around that feature. It's useful to get an orientation on where I'll need to make edits, and get an overview of the relevant system overview that's related to that feature (where views are generated, actions are handled, etc).

- If there is UI involved, where is the code that renders the UI?
- If there is event handling, where is the event handler registered, and where is it implemented?
- If there are services involved, which ones are called?

Before we dive into this feature, guide me through exploring how nearby or similar features work, so that our solution will be consistent with the existing architecture.
