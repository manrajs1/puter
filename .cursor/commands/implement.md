## Implement milestone step

I'm a new developer, and I want to use AI to code, but I want to understand and review all the code that's being developed.

Each milestone should be divided up into smaller steps. Implement the next step only. Each step should be something that I can verify through manual testing, and have a small amount of code.

Stop after the completion of the step, so we can test the code, and discuss the implementation. When we’re ready, we’ll continue to the next step.
